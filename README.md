</div>

A desktop companion for VRChat: see where your friends are, keep a history of the people you've met and the worlds you've visited, manage your favorites, and more.

VRCX-0 is a ground-up rewrite of VRCX by one of its former maintainers. Rebuilt in Rust, it's faster and lighter, and years of history stay smooth.

## Highlights

- **Years of history stay smooth** — data that makes VRCX sluggish runs
  smoothly in VRCX-0, even on low-end PCs and home servers
- **About 50%–70% less memory than VRCX**
- **Background mode needs just tens of MB of memory**, with all core features
  still running
- **Smaller than a single avatar bundle** — just over 10 MB to download, just
  over 30 MB installed; less than a tenth the size of VRCX
- **Seamless migration** — imports your VRCX database and settings
  automatically; VRCX's own database is never modified, so you can switch back
  at any time

### Only in VRCX-0

- **Social AI** — insights into your VRChat social life: who you play with
  most, who you're drifting away from, when friends are most likely online;
  just connect the AI service you already use
- **Sidebar Mode** — keep an eye on friends from a narrow sidebar; docks to the
  screen edge and auto-hides on Windows and macOS
- **Keyboard shortcuts** — common actions without the mouse; global hotkey on
  Windows
- **Lock** — lock the interface with a code to protect your privacy
- **Sharing** — share links for world collections, worlds, avatars, and
  instances

### For advanced users

- **MCP server** — let external AI tools use your local social data directly
- **Integration API** — real-time in-game data for third-party apps
- **Headless collector** — record on an always-on server and sync desktop history;
  see [setup instructions](HEADLESS.md)

| Game log              | All accounts mixed together                                            | Stored per account                                                            |

Everything else VRCX does, VRCX-0 does too.

## Install

Grab the file for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/Map1en/VRCX-0/releases/latest):

| Platform              | File                                        |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Windows               | `VRCX-0_<version>_windows_x86_64_setup.exe` |
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | `VRCX-0_<version>_macos_aarch64.dmg`        |
| macOS (Intel)         | `VRCX-0_<version>_macos_x86_64.dmg`         |
| Linux                 | `.AppImage`, `.deb`, or `.rpm`              |

On macOS, if the first launch is blocked, open **System Settings → Privacy &
Security** and click **Open Anyway**.

### Linux

Hardware acceleration for the app interface is off by default. Turn it on under
**Settings → System → Hardware acceleration (experimental)**; if the interface
doesn't display properly, VRCX-0 turns it back off automatically. Setting
`WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER` yourself hides this option.
